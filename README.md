# codealpha_network_intrusion_detection_system
This is the Task 3 in Cybersecurity , To create a network intrusion detection system.

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security tool that monitors network traffic to detect suspicious activities and potential threats.

The project involves creating a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort on an Ubuntu system. It starts with the installation and configuration of Snort, an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system. The setup includes defining rules to detect malicious activities and logging any suspicious traffic. The system was tested by generating various types of network traffic from a Kali Linux machine, simulating potential attacks. Snort effectively monitored the network, identifying and logging intrusion attempts based on the predefined rules. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of a NIDS for enhanced network security, providing insights into how such systems can detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.
